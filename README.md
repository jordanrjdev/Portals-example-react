# Portals in React.js

Portals provide a first-class option to render children into a DOM node that exists outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy, as stated in the official React.js documentation.

Portals are useful when we want to render components but our parent has a hidden overflow or a defined width and height, modals are an ideal example so we are going to build a modal from scratch and apply good user accessibility practices.

You can see the complete code of the example here in this [github repository](https://github.com/jordanrjdev/Portals-example-react)
